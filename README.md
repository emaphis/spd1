# spd1

Clojure versions of solutions from Introduction to Systematic Program Design Part 1 course from UBC.

## Usage

In order to more closely follow the structure of the Racket/BSL source files in the course, expectations (using `expect`, the closest Clojure equivalent to `check-expect`) are mixed in with the source code.
Look in `src/spd1/` for a file corresponding to each problem/solution from the course (so far).

I'm going to assume you're using [LightTable](http://lighttable.com) since that's really the easiest way to get up and running with Clojure on any platform.
It also works very with the files as structured here: add the repo root to the workspace in LT, navigate into the `src/` tree to open a file, then `ctl-shift-enter` (or `cmd-shift-enter` on Mac) to evaluate it.
You'll see the pass/fail tests at the bottom.
